            <p>Seymour  Papert (1928&ndash;) is seen by many as the pioneer of Computing in schools. He is  probably best known as the co-developer of the Logo programming language in the  late 1960s.<br>
              <br>
              Logo  introduced the idea of turtle graphics, in which a computer-controlled robot  &lsquo;turtle&rsquo;, equipped with a pen, moves, turns and draws to make shapes on paper.  A child who is programming Logo can define their own &lsquo;words&rsquo; (procedures) so,  for example, the turtle could be programmed to make a square by giving the  command, &lsquo;Move forward and turn 90&deg;&rsquo; four times. <br>
              <br>
              Papert  saw Logo as more than a programming language, though; he believed it was a  powerful tool for pupils to develop their thinking skills.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="text-warning"><em>I began to see how children who had learned to program  computers could use very concrete computer models to think about thinking and  to learn about learning and in doing so, enhance their powers as psychologists  and as epistemologists.</em><span id="p7Tooltip_1" class="popuplinks"><sup>20</sup></span></span><br>
              <br>
              Insights  such as this lie at the heart of the changes in the curriculum from ICT to  Computing. Many teachers may recall Logo from their own school days, and Logo  was a key influence on Scratch, which was developed by one of Papert&rsquo;s PhD  students.<br>
              <br>
              Inspired  by his work with Logo was Papert&rsquo;s theory of learning: constructionism. Put  simply, this is the theory that people learn best through making things for  other people.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="text-warning"><em>Learning as &lsquo;building knowledge structures&rsquo; . . . happens  especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged  in constructing a public entity.</em><span id="p7Tooltip_2" class="popuplinks"><sup>21</sup></span></span><br>
              <br>
              Pupils  learn more when they write about a topic than when they read about it,  especially if they know that you, and perhaps others, will be reading what they  write. It seems likely that this is true of every aspect of Computing.<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pupils  will learn computer science far more effectively by writing programs to show to  others. </li>
              <li>Pupils  will learn to use information technology more effectively if they&rsquo;re doing  something creative, such as making a presentation, website or video, especially  if this is to be shown to others.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Pupils  will develop a richer digital literacy if they document what they know and  learn for others through blog posts, audio recordings or screencasts. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When  teaching the Computing curriculum, look wherever you can for practical,  creative projects that pupils can work on, perhaps individually, perhaps with a  partner, or as part of a small group: this, after all, is how programming and  information technology happens in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; and on most university  courses. The projects you set are more likely to be motivating if they&rsquo;re  linked to your pupils&rsquo; own interests and enthusiasms. These might be to do with  other curriculum areas, the life of the school, or their interests beyond  school.<br>
              <br>
              Also, look for an audience  for pupils&rsquo; work, whether they&rsquo;re presenting to one another, writing for a  public blog, creating software or digital content for younger pupils, or  planning to upload their work for others to see, via Scratch or a school  YouTube account.<br>

            <p>Games  can be very motivating, and pupils often enjoy evaluating each other&rsquo;s work.  Remember, though, that such projects are <em>not </em>an end in themselves: the  focus should remain on developing knowledge and understanding of Computing <em>through </em>such activities, however engaging they may be. Your role as a teacher  extends beyond setting the challenge and providing support in projects, to  helping pupils understand the ideas that lie at the heart of the creative work  in which they&rsquo;re engaged, and to helping pupils make the connection between  these concepts.<br>
              <br>
              Here  are a few examples of projects.<br>
              <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Making  and editing a cookery video in which the algorithm of a recipe is clearly  illustrated.</li>
              <li>Creating  a video game using characters and settings from a shared reading book.</li>
              <li>Developing  educational software for younger pupils to practise mental arithmetic.</li>
              <li>Creating  a scripted or stop-motion animation telling the story of an email&rsquo;s journey  from sender to recipient.</li>
              <li>Adding  content to the Simple English Wikipedia to explain Computing concepts (or  concepts from other topics pupils are studying) to a global audience.</li>
              <li>Developing  a micro-site for the school on how to use the web safely, respectfully and responsibly.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many  other ideas for creative projects will suggest themselves, either starting  from, or ending with, the programme of study content.<br>
              American  educationalist David Jonassen<span id="p7Tooltip_3" class="popuplinks"><sup>22</sup></span> coined the term &lsquo;meaningful learning&rsquo;  to describe projects such as these. He identified five essential aspects for  learning to be described as &lsquo;meaningful&rsquo;, and these might help in considering  what makes for effective learning in Computing.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Active: </strong>Pupils  should be actively engaged in their learning &ndash; typically this will be <em>doing </em>something  on a computer, but it could also be taking part in a discussion or an activity  away from the computer, such as role-play to illustrate how packets of data  travel across the Internet.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Constructive: </strong>This  can be understood both in the sense of constructing meaning, developing pupils&rsquo;  mental model of computation and technologies, and in the sense of making  something, whether this is a computer program, a presentation or a blog post.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Intentional: </strong>Ideally,  pupils should have some degree of <em>choice </em>over how they tackle a task or  project, or perhaps even over the task or project itself. It is unlikely they  will learn much from copying a worked solution off an IWB (interactive whiteboard) screen, and many  projects can be constructed or adapted to allow plenty of scope for individual  creativity.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Authentic: </strong>Wherever  possible, try to link activities with pupils&rsquo; own experiences, both within and  beyond school: cross-curricular projects work very well, as do those linked to  the life of the school itself, or to pupils&rsquo; experiences of technology.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Cooperative: </strong>Computing,  in both industrial and academic contexts, is a collaborative endeavour. Where  possible, construct activities so that pupils can work together, supporting one  another in their learning.<br><br>
              This  is not to say that creative, collaborative projects are the only, or in some  circumstances even the best, approaches to teaching Computing. There are many  topics where pupils will learn 
              a lot through classroom  discussion, teacher demonstration or watching high-quality media.</p>
